A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a simple tool used to estimate whether a person has a healthy body weight in relation to their height. 
It is a numerical value calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilogram(kg) by the square of their height in meters(m). 
The BMI is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese.

The formula to calculate BMI is:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2
