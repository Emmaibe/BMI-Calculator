A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a simple tool used to estimate whether a person has a healthy body weight in relation to their height. 
It is a numerical value calculated by dividing a person's weight in pound(lb) by the square of their height in inches(in). 
The BMI is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight e.t.c

The formula to calculate BMI is:

BMI = weight (lb) / (height (in))^2 * 703
